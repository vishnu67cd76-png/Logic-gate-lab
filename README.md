# Logic-gate-lab

Logic Gate Lab is a fully interactive web-based simulator designed to help students visualize and understand the behavior of fundamental digital logic gates. The interface is clean, responsive, and optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
The project currently supports AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates, each with real-time switching, glowing indicators, Boolean expressions, and dynamically generated truth tables.
